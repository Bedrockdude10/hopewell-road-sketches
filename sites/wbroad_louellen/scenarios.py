"""Treatment proposals for this site.

Three escalating options, all sharing the same crosswalk upgrade:
  1. continental crosswalks
  2. + 11 ft travel lanes with the recovered width marked as parking
  3. + mountable pedestrian bulb-outs (drivable by trucks/EMS)

Existing conditions come from the July 2026 Hopewell Crosswalk Inventory and OSM;
see this site config.yaml. Every width here is osm_derived or estimated, NOT field-
measured, so treat the lane/parking dimensions below as a design study rather than a
construction drawing.

    per side). So the recovered width - half the roadway minus 11 ft - is what's available,

      * >= PARKING_DEPTH_FT + 1: an 8 ft stall, with the remainder as a striped buffer
        between the stall and the kerb (add_marked_parking's curb_offset_ft).
      * >= MIN_PARKING_DEPTH_FT: a single stall taking the whole recovered width.
      * less than that: no parking - paint-only lane narrowing, since a 6 ft stall isn't
        a stall. The leg still gets its 11 ft lanes.

    Printed per leg so the trade-off is visible rather than buried in geometry.
